Discrimination of Automotive Window Tint using ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy and Chemometrics.

This dataset was collected by Braden Grant at Curtin University in 2019, under the supervision of Dr Georgina 
Sauzier and Prof. Simon Lewis. Automotive tints were analysed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Chemometric analysis 
was carried out to investigate variations in the adhesive composition, which could be used to discriminate or 
identify tints based on their provenance for forensic purposes.
